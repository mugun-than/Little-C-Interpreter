# Recursive-Descent-Parser
###Project Overview:
       In this project, I set out to design and implement a Recursive Descent Parser for a subset of numeric expressions using the C programming language. This parser serves as a crucial component in the world of compiler construction and programming language development.
The numeric expressions that could be parsed by this resucrsive descent 
parser are composed of,
        -> Numbers
        -> Operators ( +, -, *, /, %, ^, = )
        -> Paranthesis
        -> Variables
