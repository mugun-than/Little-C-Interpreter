# Recursive-Descent-Parser
Project Overview:
       In this project, I set out to design and implement a Recursive Descent Parser for a subset of numeric expressions using the C programming language. This parser serves as a crucial component in the world of compiler construction and programming language development.
       
Key Features and Accomplishments:

**Lexer and Tokenization:** 
           I built a lexer to tokenize input expressions, breaking them down into meaningful components like numbers, operators, and parentheses.

**Recursive Descent Parsing:** 
           Leveraging the power of recursive functions, I implemented a parser that can analyze and interpret complex numeric expressions by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.

**Operator Precedence:** 
           To ensure the correct order of operations, I carefully handled operator precedence, guaranteeing that expressions were evaluated accurately.

**Error Handling:** 
           Robust error handling capabilities were added to detect and report syntax errors, helping to enhance the overall reliability of the parser.

**Subset of Numeric Expressions:** 
           My parser is tailored to handle a specific subset of numeric expressions, allowing for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as parentheses for grouping.

**Testing and Validation:** 
           I rigorously tested the parser with various input expressions, including edge cases and complex scenarios, to ensure its correctness and reliability.

Why It Matters:
Developing a Recursive Descent Parser is a significant achievement because it plays a pivotal role in various fields, including programming language design, compiler construction, and even calculator applications. This project showcases my ability to tackle complex problems, employ algorithmic thinking, and create efficient and robust software solutions.

What's Next:
I'm excited to continue expanding and refining this parser, potentially extending its capabilities to support more advanced expressions and incorporating it into larger projects where parsing plays a fundamental role. I'm also eager to collaborate with others interested in parsing and compiler development.

        Numbers
        Operators ( +, -, *, /, %, ^, = )
        Paranthesis
        Variables
       '''
